      <h2>How We Refactor and How We Mine it? A Large-Scale Empirical
Study on Refactoring Activities in Open Source Systems</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>In this empirical study, we examined refactoring activities to better understand the developer&#39;s
perception of refactoring by mining and automatically classifying refactoring activities in 1,706 open
source Java projects. We go
beyond analyzing whether refactoring have been intended to fix code smells, by adding dimensions related to verifying whether production files are refactored similarly to test files, identifying whether
the application of refactoring is randomly distributed among developers, analyzing the frequency of
refactorings during the release and testing periods, and detecting the type of activities that refactorings
are interleaved with.</p><br>
      <p>More specifically, the research questions that we investigated are:</p>
      <p><strong>RQ1. Do software developers perform different types of refactoring operations on test code versus
production code?</strong></p>
      <p>The rationale behind this research question is to investigate whether the refactoring strategies differ by the nature of the target file. We answer it by seeking any patterns that developers specifically apply to either production or test codes.</p>
      <p><strong>RQ2. Is there a subset of developers, within the development team, who are responsible for refactoring
the code?</strong></p>
      <p>This research question challenges the scalability of several papers that have performed developer interviews and demonstrated that only a subset of developers perform major refactoring activities. In our study, we verify whether the task of refactoring is equally distributed among all developers or if it is the responsibility of a subset of developers. We also consider whether it is proportional to each developer's overall contribution to the project in terms of commits.</p>
      <p><strong>RQ3. Are there more refactoring activities before project releases than after?</strong></p>
      <p>Refactoring is known to be solicited around  major releases, yet there is not enough information on the nature of activities applied. To answer this research question, we monitor the refactoring activities for a time window centered by the release date, then we compare the frequency of refactoring before and after the release of the new version.</p>
      <p><strong>RQ4. Is refactoring activity on production code preceded by the addition or modification of test
code?</strong></p>
      <p>Similarly to the previous research question, we compare the frequency of refactoring before and after the creation or updates of a large set of test code.</p>
      <p><strong>RQ5. What is the developer&#39;s purpose of the applied refactorings?</strong></p>
      <p>We determine the motivation of the developer through the classification of the commit containing these refactoring operations. It identifies the type of development tasks that refactorings were interleaved with, e.g., updating a feature, or debugging.</p><br>
